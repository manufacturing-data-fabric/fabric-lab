# ðŸ§  Fabric Lab

The **Fabric Lab** is a modular, containerized testbed for data-centric industrial architectures. It includes services for message brokering (Kafka), semantic data storage (GraphDB), device simulation (OPC UA servers), and interactive data exploration (JupyterLab). Everything is orchestrated via Docker Compose.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

---

### 2. Startup

To start the entire lab environment:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To stop and clean everything:

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans --volumes
```

---

## ðŸ“‚ Project Highlights

### OPC UA Simulation
Three simulated OPC UA devices are started:
- `assembly_station` â†’ port **4841**
- `cnc_milling` â†’ port **4842**
- `injection_molding` â†’ port **4843**

Each is based on the [`opcua_sample_server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/stephantrattnig/opcua_sample_server) Docker image and configured via runtime arguments.

---

### JupyterLab

A JupyterLab container is available on port **8888**, with:
- Tokenless login (`--NotebookApp.token=''`)
- Pre-cloned client repo: [data-fabric/client](https://gitlab.lrz.de/data-fabric/client)
- Persistent volume at `/home/jovyan/work`

---

### Kafka & UI
- Kafka is accessible on **localhost:29092**
- Kafka UI at **http://localhost:8080**

---

### GraphDB

GraphDB is available at **http://localhost:7200**  
It is initialized using a `.ttl` file via the `init_graphdb` service.

---

### Portainer

Portainer UI is available at **http://localhost:9000**  
You can use it to visually manage and monitor your containers, networks, and volumes.

---

## ðŸ§  Network

All services share the `fabric-lab` network for seamless internal communication.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Volumes

| Volume Name       | Purpose                            |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|
| `portainer_data`  | Persistent Portainer data storage  |
| `jupyterlab_data` | JupyterLab notebooks and work dir  |

---

## âœ… Notes
- All OPC UA servers expose port `4840` internally but are mapped externally to unique ports.
- JupyterLab is launched as root to allow volume folder creation.
- Git repository cloning in JupyterLab is done on container startup.

###### deprecated
This is a lab for the data fabric architecture. It includes a mock that shows all the relevant components in interplay, including

- A central message broker kafka instance
- exemplary mock OPC UA data sources (3x)
- OPC UA Connectors
- a Graph Database storing the central knowledge graph
- a python environment for the execution of the client or the agent



starting

```commandline
docker compose up -d
```

stopping and removing all containers:
```commandline
docker compose down
```
add a -v flag if the volumes may be destroyed too


portainer setting:
